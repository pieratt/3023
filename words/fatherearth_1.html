    <h1>The absence of an archetype — Father Earth<br>
      August 2023<br>
    Status:<span class="yellow"> Incomplete</span></h1>
<p> Sharp red leaves on neon sky. The wind kicked, trees clawed, thick clouds glowered, it was an aspect of nature I’d never witnessed. Angry, threatening, an arrogant presence that had come home to remind everyone of how badly they’d fucked up. It felt like a dad, my dad, and nature was now permeated with a truth I’d never recognized: the hard truths of being a man and fatherhood are as natural and integrated into nature as anything else, including motherhood or womanhood or the moon or gods or math or children or violence or shadow. 
    </p>

    <p>Why aren't men associated with the Earth? Men “get” god himself, of course, culturally speaking, the old man in the sky, but you’ll note that He sits quite literally on a (human-made) throne in a (disconnected) sky. He is specifically removed from anything planetary, muddy, dirty, natural.  
    </p>

    <p><span class="pullquote">We have no healthy, elegant, aspirational archetypes or mythologies which directly associate Men with Earth in the same way that women “get to” have Her as one of their archetypes.</span> We have the Green Man, an obscure chaos agent from european lore who is intentionally confusing and not much for aspirational qualities. Even Odin, a wonderful combination of feminine wisdom and masculine action, is sacrificed ~on the tree, and is never identified with the larger cosmos as such.
    </p>
    <p>To what degree does this lack of a symbol or myth speak to the disembodied nature of the western man? Of course we abuse the Earth if we feel no attachment to it, to our bodies, to our intuition and what our gut has to say. How different would our relationship with the planet be if a primary symbol of manhood were an archetypal planetary symbol? Imagine Zeus and Gaia as a single concept. We know this is possible because we already have one in the form of Mother Earth, a fantastically rich and dynamic symbol which we carry in our hearts and which shapes our relationship with both women and the Earth. 
    </p>
    <p>Inversely, of course men will subjugate the Earth to our whim if we think of the Earth as a woman, isn’t the leadership of Men<sup>1</sup> one of the primary tenants of our judeo-christian literature? 
    </p>
    <p>As someone fascinated by cosmologies and the concepts which bind us, who also works professionally in words and symbols and culture, this immediately felt like the type of opportunity I could actually speak into.
    </p>
    <p>The notion of developing a brand or product line which built cool, healthy, tasteful, interesting, provocative associations between masculinity and The Earth, felt like an obvious Good Idea, so I began to pursue it earnest. 
    </p>
    <p> In this era, entertainment and brands hold the role in culture once held by gods and religion. If you want to affect culture, you can either start a brand or create something entertaining. Launch a movie or a product line, either one will give you access to the unconscious of millions wherein you can build up additional habits with apps, services, merch, all kinds of lifestyle choices that, again, used to be the domain of religion and family.
    </p>
    <p>“Father Earth” itself is not a product, it's a concept, so if I wanted to see more of it in the market, I would need to attach it to something cool which could travel our distribution networks and spread the message. This was 2016 and cannabis legalization was starting to roll across the country. Big Name Cannabis Brands felt inevitable, Busch acquisitions and national campaigns felt inevitable. Father Earth as a cannabis brand which provided a great product while inventing and scaling a new mythology of some kind of Masculine Planet symbol, took immediately hold in my mind.
    </p>
    <p>A few hundred sketches later and I'd shared the idea with a few friends, an old forum. The response was largely negative, with a few pockets of proclamaitions of brilliance, the feedback largely centering around misogyny, colonialism and hints of fascism... which... I mean it really seemed to drive the point home. </p>
    <p><span class="yellow">...to be completed...</span></p>
    <p class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> <span class="italic">"isn’t the leadership of Men one of the primary tenants of our judeo-christian literature?"</span> I've theories on this which I'll talk about later: TLDR — I suspect the way Men and Women are handled by the church is utterly at odds with their intended use as descriptions  Masculine-Yang and Feminine-Yin properties, e.g. the feminine literally cannot give sermons because sermons are linear directed speach, Yin and Leadership are effectively antonyms. And if not a misunderstanding, then it is at least a fascinating opportunity for evolution.</p>
